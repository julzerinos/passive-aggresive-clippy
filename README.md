# Passive Aggresive Clippy

## Clippy is back

And he's here to help you (albeit passive-agressively) with your emails, to make sure your message are as clean and friendly as humanely possible (probably not much). Just go ahead and type your beautiful words away and watch for the highlighted sections - click them and Clippy will be sure to help you with the rest!

## The project

A small project as a tribute to the wonderful thins I've read in the corporate email thread lifecycles. Here is me hoping that my friends and co-workers will stumble upon a tool to help them notice the *little things*.

## Techincal

* *reated in Vue 3 + Typescript.
* Inspired and powered by [Smore's ClippyJS](https://www.smore.com/clippy-js)

# Passive Aggressive Clippy

## Note 19/10/2023

`ClippyJS` seems to be failing with new builds which means clippy won't show up to proofread your emails. Truly a sad day for all Clippy fans out there. I probably will never return to this application again, so let this be a testament to the irriversible desolation of time.

## Clippy is back

And he's here to help you (albeit passive-aggressively) with your emails â€“ so that you can be absolutely sure your messages are as friendly as humanely possible (which is probably not that much). Go ahead and type away with your beautiful words - watch for the highlighted sections and click them, so that Clippy can help you with the rest!

## The project

A small project as a tribute to the wonderful things I've read in the corporate email thread lifecycles. Here is to me hoping that my friends and co-workers will stumble upon a tool to help them notice the *little things*.

## Techincal

* Created in Vue 3 + Typescript.
* Inspired and powered by [Smore's ClippyJS](https://www.smore.com/clippy-js)
